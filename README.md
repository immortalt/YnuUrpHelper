备注：云大已经更换了URP系统，本客户端已经无法正常连接，仅供技术参考。  

不朽URP助手，相当于云南大学URP的强化了教学评估和选课功能的客户端。  
我将这个助手开源，希望可以帮助到云南大学对开发云南大学URP客户端有兴趣的朋友，  
或者可以大家一起完善这个软件，方便更多的学生。  
这个软件的原理和官方网站的原理是一样的，就是通过http协议收发数据，和后端交互，所以并不会被后端检测到异常。  
现在可以实现登陆云南大学URP、查看个人信息、一键教学评估、一键手动/全自动选课、查看已选课程、退课等功能。

Note: Yunnan University has replaced the URP system, and this client can no longer connect normally. It is for technical reference only.  

The Immortal URP Assistant is equivalent to a client with enhanced teaching evaluation and course selection functions based on the URP of Yunnan University.  
I made this assistant open source, hoping to help friends of Yunnan University who are interested in developing the URP client of Yunnan University, or we can improve this software together to facilitate more students.  
The principle of this software is the same as that of the official website, which is to send and receive data through the http protocol and interact with the back-end, so it will not be detected by the back-end.  
It has realized the functions of logging in to the URP of Yunnan University, viewing personal information, one-key teaching evaluation, one-key manual/automatic course selection, viewing selected courses, and withdrawal.
